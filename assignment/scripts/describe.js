// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/

// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// I create a variable called number  
// Then set it to the value of 1 which is a number
// Then the number itself is added by one 
// Then we create a compound conditional 
// If the number is greater than or equal to 2
// console log `yes`

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}

*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// A variable was created called name and assign the word Dane
// A conditional was created, if name equals mary, it will console log 'Hi Mary',
//  Otherwise it will console log 'How do you do?'
//  At the end it will console log 'Hi Mary'

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// A variable called secret was created as well as a variable called code. The variables were assigned 123 
// Then a conditional was created : if code equals 123, secret is equal to the value of super, code is equal to code and multiplied by 2 
// otherwise if code is greater than 250 then secret is equal to duper 
// lastly console log secret 
// At the end it will console log 

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

*/
//  create a variable called isStudent and assign it true, create a variable called age and assign it the number 34, create another variable called zip and assign it the number 55407
// write a conditional : if isStudent is equal to true and both true zip is greater than the number 80000, it will console log `You're a student on the West Coast!`
// otherwise if isStudent equals false or age is less than the number 30, it will console log 'What are your hobbies?'
// otherwise if isStudent is equal to true, it will console log 'Welcome to Prime!'
// otherwise it will console log 'How about the weather?'
// At the end console log ' Welcome to Prime'

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/

//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'blue';
let colorTwo = 'red';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
  colorTwo = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 && time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(age >= minAge) {
  console.log('enter');
}
